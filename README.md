# Machine-Learning
# Disease Predictor using Machine Learning

# Overview:
This project implements a disease prediction system using machine learning models. 
It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to input symptoms and predict the possible disease. 
The system uses three machine learning models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.

# Features:
1. Symptom Input: Users can input up to 5 symptoms from a predefined list.
2. Disease Prediction: Predicts the possible disease based on the input symptoms using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classifiers.
3. Accuracy Calculation: Displays the accuracy of each model on test data.

# Data:
The project uses a dataset containing various symptoms and their corresponding diseases. The dataset is split into training and testing data.

# Machine Learning Models:
  # 1. Decision Tree:
Training: The model is trained using the training dataset.
Prediction: Predicts the disease based on input symptoms.
Accuracy: Calculates and displays the accuracy of the model.
  # 2. Random Forest:
Training: The model is trained using the training dataset.
Prediction: Predicts the disease based on input symptoms.
Accuracy: Calculates and displays the accuracy of the model.
  # 3. Naive Bayes:
Training: The model is trained using the training dataset.
Prediction: Predicts the disease based on input symptoms.
Accuracy: Calculates and displays the accuracy of the model.

# GUI Components:
The graphical user interface is built using Tkinter and includes the following components:

Labels: For displaying instructions and results.
Entry Fields: For inputting patient name and selecting symptoms.
Buttons: For triggering disease prediction using different models.
Text Fields: For displaying predicted diseases.

# Usage: 
Input Symptoms: Select symptoms from the dropdown menus.
Predict Disease: Click the buttons to predict the disease using different models.
View Results: The predicted disease and model accuracy are displayed in the text fields.

# Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the disease_predictor.py script to start the application.
